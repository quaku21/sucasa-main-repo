SUCASA PROPERTIES COMPANY PROFILE
Executive Summary
Sucasa Properties is a premier real estate company located in Ghana, specifically known for its luxury housing units in East Legon Hills, Accra. The firm boasts of having completed and upcoming phases that provide prospective homeowners with a variety of options and features to choose from.
As a highly regarded real estate company with a dedicated team of professionals, SuCasa Properties is addressing Ghana's core housing opportunities and challenges. Well-equipped in all aspects of the real estate industry, we operate with the single aim of achieving the highest possible customer service standards. We work in several different verticals in the industry including residential and commercial construction, renovations or facelifts, property sale and rental, and property management.
The SuCasa brand echoes a sound of hope and re-assurance. The continuous increase in demand for our country's housing infrastructural assets presents a real challenge to the government. The various interventions from the government and private real estate managers and other home providers have not sufficiently addressed the menace. The government's call for public-private partnership engagement is commendable, but what is required at present is the state-of-the art technology and economic model capable of furnishing the housing infrastructural deficit gap with the needed units of affordable homes equally accessible to every nook and cranny.
The housing infrastructural deficit gap of 1.8million units implies that about 85,000 units of annual housing demand is impending - putting the market scissors of demand and supply at a nonequilibrium scale, where demand outweighs supply. In fact, the consequences are dire. To adequately, bridge this gap, and factor the ordinary Ghanaian's purchasing abilities to own a home into the solution trajectory, requires pragmatic innovations. The private sector, usually driven by profit maximization motive has not successfully addressed the housing demand index of the low to middle income earners of the economy. This is a worrying trend, if our resolve to provide affordable housing for all the citizenry is to be gauged on a realistic scale.
Many factors including the global economic crisis and its direct ramifications on rising cost of living and other debilitating consequence such as high cost of building materials on one hand; land management issues, challenges with easy and convenient access to domestic credit facilities, fraudulent intermediate brokers (Agents), rapid population growth and urbanization, and increasing middle means on the other-all account for the opposition to society's inability to completely nip the problem in the bud.
Here, when we talk about innovation, we are addressing strategic innovation, technological and scientific deficits in our social intervention schemes already on the roll out, and most importantly, engaging with the right economic model to effectively arrest the challenge. Incorporating all these into the solution benchmark has evoked the thinking, passion, and the evolution of the SuCasa Affordable Housing Scheme on the market with such an unbelievable practical and pragmatic initiative, both on the side of planning, technological invention, and economic affordability of the solution to the country's current housing infrastructural development deficit.

The Population Growth Trend.
While more established markets such as Europe, India and China have aging and often declining populations, Ghana's young population is rapidly growing. From a population strength of 29.77 million in 2018, Ghana's population growth is projected to hit 50-60 Million by 2050.
Fueled by this population growth, Ghana is experiencing a strongly rising demand for reliable housing. The flipside of the coin is rising levels of homelessness due to overpriced and inadequate housing options in many parts of Ghana.
Leveraging the most emergent technologies, highly skilled and dedicated leadership, labor force and modern construction or renovation and marketing strategies, SuCasa Properties, envisions itself as more than just a real estate; it is a lifestyle company, committed to informing and connecting worldwide communities by becoming the number one real estate company on the entire African Continent.

Our Projects
SuCasa Properties currently has properties under construction, renovation, sale, and rental throughout most urban areas of Africa. We currently have 350 properties, over 200 clients and operating and served in 6 cities in Ghana.

Background
In 2013, SuCasa Properties started as a small company initially known as Sugarcane Estates with approximately 3 employees. Founder, Michael Kwabena Owusu O'Granston-Agyapong, said the purpose of setting up the company was to “Aid people avoid litigation and fraudsters in the real estate industry”. Since then, the company has established a proud reputation and tradition for providing top quality homes and services. Over the years the young company has come of age and completed high profile projects in exclusive suburbs in Accra, Kumasi and Takoradi.

Mission
SuCasa Properties' mission is to modernize and to lead the way in the delivery of real estate services and projects in the real estate industry. We aim to modernize and advance the experience of constructing, renovating, buying, selling & renting of properties by cultivating a spirit of collaboration, innovation, and integrity. Assuring our clients of free litigation and convenience of service by doing our due diligence.

Values
Our values define how we do business and interact with our colleagues, partners, customers, and consumers. Our three core values are integrity, collaboration, and innovation.
Innovation: We employ the use of modern technology and unique marketing techniques to provide impeccable services for our customers. We combine technology, expertise, assets, and partnerships to deliver projects and services in new ways.
Integrity: Doing business with integrity is at the heart of our corporate responsibility commitments. Integrity defines how we behave, how we do business, wherever we are. It guides us to do the right thing for the long-term success of the company. We apply the highest ethical standards in everything we do.
Collaboration: The principle of building strong foundations in structures also applies to the relationship we build between our clients and us. We work closely and openly together with our clients, partners, and suppliers to deliver strong results for all. 
Diversity And Inclusion
At SuCasa Properties we strive to create an inclusive environment, empower employees and embrace diversity. We do not discriminate on who we employ or do business with based on race, gender, religion, ethnicity, nationality, and viewpoints. We focus on activities that foster inclusive relationships between colleagues, partners, customers, and consumers.
 
 
Pricing, Discounts, and Payment Plans
Sucasa Properties offers a range of pricing options to accommodate varied budgets. Here are the current prices for the different homes:
 
- 2-bedroom townhouse standard: $70,000
- 3-bedroom townhouse standard: $97,500
- 3-bedroom townhouse extended: $147,500 (Sold out)
- 4-bedroom townhouse standard: $195,000
- 4-bedroom townhouse extended: $320,000
 
Sucasa Properties maintains a transparent and straightforward pricing strategy. The prices for all our properties are fixed, ensuring uniformity and fairness for all prospective homeowners. Periodically, prices may be reviewed to align with market dynamics and our commitment to ensuring homes remain accessible to our clientele. However, any price alterations do not retroactively affect older purchases. 
Moreover, purchasing multiple homes can open doors to further discounts, though the specifics would need managerial approval. Customers intrigued by customized payment plans or splitting payments across intervals will find flexibility at Sucasa. Such customized plans require managerial sign-off. It's worth noting that our payment plan tenure currently spans a maximum of two years. 
A key aspect of our payment process revolves around transparency. For those concerned about defaulting on payments, while there is a penalty, our approach remains accommodating. We're always willing to discuss and arrive at a mutual understanding. Any questions regarding interest rates can be addressed through a detailed examination of the chosen payment plan. Our core principle of value for money is a cardinal philosophy embedded in our slogan: Building on Trust. We do not compromise on standards and our state–of–the art technology incorporates best global practices on sustainable development and climate change.
Receipts, Proof of payment, and Invoicing
Post-payment, if any customer hasn’t received their receipt within 15 working days, our accounts team stands ready to assist. Proofs of payments, whether digital or otherwise, can be forwarded to our official email: sales@sucasa.com.gh. When it comes to invoicing, Sucasa provides a single invoice for the entire home price, aligned with the property's Sales and Purchase Agreement (SPA).
Payment Structure 
 
Prospective buyers can choose from various payment plans:
1. Outright payment, which comes with a 4% discount.
2. A flexible payment plan that involves a 25% initial deposit with subsequent payments staggered over a period.
3. A one-year spread payment plan.
4. Mortgage plans, facilitated through partnerships with banks like UBA Bank, Republic Bank, and FNB Bank.
5. A custom payment plan based on individual proposals.
 
Sucasa encourages customers to check with banks for the current cedi equivalent of the quoted dollar prices due to forex market volatility. If the payment for a unit is spread over a period of time it is imperative that the client knows they will be making a payment based on the current exchange rate at the time of payment.
 
Outright Payment
An outright payment for the construction of a unit will attract a 4% discount of the total amount. This is a payment of the full and final price of a SuCasa home paid in one go.

25% upfront
An interested client will now only have to make a payment of 25% and not make any subsequent payment till their home is completed. At the moment the home is completed, a client will have to make the full payment of the balance of 75% to have access to their home. We as SuCasa have this policy in place to further reiterate and strengthen our commitment to building on trust. This however does not apply to customers who decide to make an outright full payment of the full and final price of the home they intend to purchase and the incentive for that is they get a 4% discount.

Mortgage Offerings at SuCasa Properties
Mortgage applies to our already completed three (3) and four (4) bedroom units in Phase one (1) and Phase (2) of our East Legon Hills project.
With our partnership with banks, you can take advantage of a mortgage facility whether you are a resident of Ghana or not. The mortgage can be spread over a period of up to 25 years (depending on the bank) as long as the customer meets the bank’s requirement.

Mortgage Access & Process:
At SuCasa Properties, while we do not directly approve mortgages, we have established a streamlined process to facilitate mortgage access for our clients.
To start the process, clients are required to fill out a specific form. Upon completion, we connect them with our partnered banks that specialize in offering competitive mortgage services.
This applies regardless of whether a client intends to purchase a home at O’Grantson Communities, wishes to combine mortgage with cash payments, or has a relationship with a particular bank like Absa. We act as a bridge, connecting clients to financial institutions for mortgage-related needs.
The speed of the mortgage process can be a concern for many. While we don't handle mortgage approvals directly, once clients fill out our form, they will be in touch with our partner banks, who can provide a clear timeline for the mortgage approval process.

Required Documentation:
 If clients are uncertain about the required documentation for accessing a mortgage, the process at SuCasa involves filling out our form, and we'll guide them towards the banks that will provide the necessary details on required documents.

Banking Inquiries and Details:
 When it comes to questions regarding our partner banks, intermediary banking details, or even specifics like SWIFT and SORT CODES, we understand these concerns are vital.
 For such detailed banking information or queries related to receipts and invoices, we direct our clients to our accounts department. They are specifically equipped to address these banking and financial inquiries.

CUSTOMIZED PAYMENT PLAN
As part of our flexibility policy, a client may inform us if none of these payment plans are favorable and present how they would like to go about payment for our consideration.
REFERRAL
As part of our customer loyalty reward, an amount of GHC 6,000.00 will be paid upon every referral one makes. A CRM with logins will be generated for one to track the progress of their referral.
 
DEFAULTING OR WITHDRAWAL
A client must note that a guarantee is needed to ensure that the instalments plan will be strictly adhered to. A default or withdrawal in payment of the instalment will attract a penalty. This is to ensure that the project at no point in time. will come to stagnation, to ensure a smooth completion of the process and avoid any financial loss or mishaps.

This encompasses queries pertaining to land dimensions, interior aesthetics, construction standards, and the caliber of materials employed.

This flexibility not only lets the properties stand out but also ensures they remain congruent with our brand's identity.

Mortgage and Financing Options
Sucasa Properties has forged partnerships with several banks to provide customers with favorable mortgage rates. Those interested in availing of a mortgage will be profiled based on certain criteria, such as residency status, employment details, and age. This profiling helps determine eligibility and facilitates smoother transactions with the bank.
Land
Our homes are for sale; however, the laws of the land prohibit the outright sale of lands. Therefore, the land the homes sits on is leased and renewable every 50 years.
Documentation on homes 
Additionally, upon the purchase of a home, clients receive comprehensive documentation including Sale Purchase Agreement, Architectural Drawings, Invoices, Receipts, and Land Indentures. Land Title documentation, however, might come at an extra charge
Facilities and Services
All properties under Sucasa are equipped with modern amenities.
We generally select lands in developing areas with all the necessary social amenities.
They are fitted with adequate plumbing for Ghana water. However, water getting to the communities is outside our remit and the rather that of the government institution responsible for this. We also have water tanks with each unit to avoid water shortages.
Additionally, each unit is equipped with water tanks to counteract potential water shortages. 
The monthly service fee for living in these gated communities ranges between $150 and $300, depending on the unit type.
 
Referrals and Bonuses
To encourage and appreciate word-of-mouth recommendations, Sucasa Properties offers a referral bonus of GH6,000 for every successful referral.
Service Fee and Homeowner's Association (HOA)
Sucasa Properties values the essence of community living, and to ensure seamless living experiences, service fees play an integral role. Managed by O’Grantson Communities, the service fees aren’t paid to Sucasa but directly to the O’Grantson Communities. These fees cater for the general upkeep of the gated community. Residents can look forward to round-the-clock security, routine cleaning and lawn maintenance, rubbish collection, maintenance of roads, parks, and communal spaces such as gyms and pools. For those keen on the community's governance, the HOA rules and regulations have been woven into our terms and conditions. Thus, purchasing a home within any O’Grantson Community automatically binds homeowners to these rules.

Our team is equipped to handle a range of topics, be it after-sales support, sales-related inquiries, or providing feedback on our services.

Bot or human:
To clarify, I am not a bot. My name is Michael, and it's my pleasure to assist you in any way related to Sucasa Properties. Whether it's a query, a concern, or feedback, I'm here to help.
Construction Timelines and Property Availability
Anticipation and Readiness:
The exhilaration of transitioning into a new residence is unmistakable, and at Sucasa, we deeply resonate with this sentiment. It's imperative for prospective homeowners to recognize that the house readiness timeline can vary. For instance, while properties within No.2 O’Grantson Communities are immediately available, those in No.3 O’Grantson Communities are being sold off-plan, with an anticipated completion by the end of 2023. Moreover, Phase 2 of No.2 O’Grantson Communities is on track for completion by October of this year.
Communication and Progress Updates:
At Sucasa Properties, transparent communication stands at the core of our operations. We commit to consistently updating our clients about the progression of their respective projects. To achieve this, we send monthly progress reports via email, ensuring clients remain well-informed. In the rare event of communication gaps or if clients have any specific inquiries concerning the reports, our dedicated team is always on standby to provide the necessary assistance.
Land Lease and Ownership**
Property ownership at Sucasa comes with a 50-year renewable land lease. For homeowners, the renewal process is hassle-free, as Sucasa handles the renewal process on behalf of its residents, albeit for a fee plus the renewal costs. Upon finalizing property acquisition, homeowners are awarded a land title certificate.
Exchange Rates and Payments in Ghana Cedis
Given the dynamic nature of foreign exchange, Sucasa employs the bank rate at the time of payment, without a fixed cedi rate. Prospective homeowners can check the prevailing rate with their local banks.
Investment Opportunities and Returns on Investment
Investors eying a 4-bedroom house at Sucasa can anticipate a return on investment (ROI) of at least 30%.
Defect Liability Period
Quality assurance remains a cornerstone of Sucasa's promise. Our properties come with a 1-year defect liability period. 
Insurance and Risk Management: 
Sucasa Properties prioritizes the safety and security of the homes it sells. While we don't provide home insurance in the traditional sense, we offer a one-year defect-liability period. This means that any damages within the home that occur within this first year are covered. This includes damages from unforeseen incidents and even those related to natural disasters. For comprehensive information on what is specifically covered, we encourage our customers to refer to our terms and conditions.
 
 
Gazumping
We don't engage in gazumping. A property is only taken off the market once an initial payment has been made.
Market and Investment Information:
In the real estate market of Ghana, Sucasa Properties stands out as a remarkable investment opportunity. Our homes are in high demand, often selling out even before the completion of construction. This demand is attributed to the fact that we offer properties that are about 30% to 70% below the typical market standard. The value proposition we offer doesn’t stop at purchasing; even those looking to resell or rent find exceptional value in our properties. While the current rental market in the area remains robust, the resell value of our 4-bedroom houses, for instance, stays competitive, benefiting from our below-market pricing strategy. For those considering additional costs, property taxes are inherent with property ownership in Ghana. However, on the topic of special tax incentives or programs for property owners, I don't have that information readily available. For a potential investment in Sucasa Properties, it might be best to directly engage with our supervisors for detailed insights.
Refund, 100% Cash-back Guarantee and Trust:
Trust is paramount in the real estate industry, and Sucasa doesn’t take that lightly. We proudly offer a 100% cash back guarantee policy, a testament to our commitment and the confidence we have in our offerings. Our clients can start the refund process simply by filling out a form and having it signed. However, the exact period for refunds is stipulated in the SPA. This transparent approach solidifies the trust our clients place in us.
Company Information and Expansion:  
For a comprehensive look at Sucasa’s history, leadership, and strategic direction, our website offers a treasure trove of information. From the company's leadership structure to our ambitions, our website details our journey, our industry presence, and our future projects. We invite all interested parties to visit https://sucasa.com.gh for this information. Our longstanding presence in the market and our ambitious plans hint at our intentions, which include potentially expanding beyond Accra.

Whether it's a school, parking facilities, storage, laundry services, or utility supply, our communities are crafted to ensure residents have everything they need within arm's reach. While we are available to provide assistance with most inquiries, specific details like property taxes, utility costs, and the exact costs of home maintenance are areas we guide our residents to seek specific information on, as these can vary and may not be within our direct purview.
 
 
Community and Neighbourhood Information
Sucasa Properties holds a stellar reputation for selecting lands specifically in developing areas that are equipped with all the vital social amenities. Prioritizing safety and convenience, every Sucasa community guarantees round-the-clock security and exceptional amenities that stand unparalleled in Ghana. The company’s vision is supported by a dedicated team of professionals who consistently deliver top-notch services ensuring buyers receive the best value for their money and investment.
One might notice that the properties in these communities are built close to one another. However, any potential risks, such as fire outbreaks or other natural calamities, have been meticulously considered. Each community undergoes thorough planning, and we collaborate with government authorities to ensure all necessary certifications are acquired before we commence building. As for other amenities like schools, hospitals, and essential services, their proximity is a testament to our strategic land selection, always emphasizing accessibility.
Furthermore, homeowners in the area are introduced to the HOA (Homeowners Association) managed by the O’Grantson Communities, offering them an opportunity to be part of a close-knit, organized community.
Environmental and Safety Concerns
Environmental concerns are at the forefront of our agenda. In line with this, Sucasa Properties carefully selects lands in developing areas that are not only equipped with all crucial social amenities but also those that have been vetted for environmental safety. Our communities not only offer unmatched security in Ghana but also ensure peace of mind when it comes to potential hazards. 
While the properties are built in proximity to each other, our communities are crafted with foresight. We work closely with governmental authorities to ensure our buildings are certified and meet all safety regulations. Be it concerns about noise, traffic, dust, or other environmental factors, we've got it covered.
Rental and Property Restrictions
Every potential homeowner should be aware of the HOA rules and regulations. These regulations, integrated into our terms and conditions, must be agreed upon when purchasing a home within any of our O’Grantson Communities. The terms and conditions cover a wide range of topics, from renting out properties to pet ownership and renovation restrictions. For those who need a detailed understanding, we always recommend liaising with a representative more acquainted with these terms to provide a comprehensive explanation.
Cultural and Social Considerations
When it comes to the cultural and social fabric of the area, there are guidelines embedded within the HOA rules and regulations of the O’Grantson Communities.

However, we always encourage homeowners to integrate and engage with the local community for a more enriched living experience.
